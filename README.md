zh2 is an extremely minimalist theme that focuses on the content without distractions. It has the content and almost nothing else. No sidebar. No header. No widgets. No comments. No search. No dynamic sidebar. No nothing.

This theme is uncopyrighted -- use as you like, spread it, sell it, do whatever you want. Thanks and enjoy.


Basic Setup
---------------------------------
You'll need to edit several pages in the Wordpress theme editor - go to Wordpress admin, then Appearance, then editor (after you've activated this theme).

- Header
By default, the header will display your blog's name followed by the tagline. These are set in the Wordpress Settings -> General.

- Footer
Right now, there's an "uncopyright" link, but it will go to my uncopyright page. Create your own, or put a copyright notice here, or remove it. Feel free to put whatever links you want in the footer.

- Subscribe
Change the links in the footer section to have your RSS and email and twitter links. If you use Feedburner, like I do, get your Feedburner RSS and email subscription links.


Again, there are no comments. You'll need to add these in to the theme if you want them. It's not that hard -- just copy comments php files and code from other themes, and add it to this theme.

This theme is designed to be as minimalist as possible, so I've stripped out a lot of functions that other themes have. That's the choice I've made and I like it that way.

This theme is "as is" - any bugs, you need to fix it. Any changes you want, you'll need to make them.
